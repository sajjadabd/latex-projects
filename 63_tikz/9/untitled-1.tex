To include a yellow note into a document insert the 
code:
\begin{verbatim}
\yellownote{
   Message into a yellow note. We just want to see how it 
   will look.
}
\end{verbatim}
and you will see the first yellow note at the 
margin of the page.
\yellownote{
Message into a yellow note. We just want to see how it 
will look.
}
Include more text then...

This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 

And when neccesary, change the size of the yellow note 
with the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1.5}{
   Resizeable yellow note.
}
\end{verbatim}
to get the second one... 
\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1.5}{Resizeable yellow note.}
Each of the arguments are: \verb|{width}{height}| 
in centimeters. You do not need to include the 
unit in the argument. The instruction already 
knows it. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 
This text is only a test. This text is only a test. 

I hope this help you improve your design.
